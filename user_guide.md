User Guide: AI Job Role Suggester
Introduction
This document provides a comprehensive guide for utilizing the AI Job Role Suggester application. Its purpose is to facilitate the analysis of resumes for the identification of suitable, skill-aligned career opportunities.

Operational Procedure
To obtain personalized job role suggestions, please adhere to the following sequential process.

Step 1: Accessing the Web Portal

start the backend app( wait for the app to launch )
<https://job-role-suggestor-api.onrender.com>

Launch a standard web browser and navigate to the application's live URL:
<https://job-role-suggestor.vercel.app/>

Step 2: Submitting a Resume

The user interface provides an option to upload a document.

Select the "Choose file" button and specify the location of your resume on your local machine. The application is configured to accept documents exclusively in the PDF format.

Step 3: Awaiting AI Analysis (Operational Note)

Upon file submission, the system will initiate a multi-stage analysis, indicated by status messages such as "Parsing your resume..." and "Analyzing skills...".

It is important to note that the backend API is hosted on a complimentary service tier, which enters an idle state following 15 minutes of inactivity. Consequently, an initial request after a period of dormancy may require approximately 30 to 60 seconds to process as the server reinitializes. This behavior is standard for the service plan in use, and subsequent requests will exhibit significantly lower latency.

Step 4: Reviewing the Analysis Output

Upon completion of the analysis, the results will be rendered on the user interface, organized into three distinct sections:

Top Prediction: This section displays the job role for which the model has the highest degree of confidence, accompanied by the corresponding confidence score.

Extracted Skills: This presents a comprehensive list of the professional skills identified by the AI from the submitted resume.

Other Suggestions: This section furnishes two alternative job roles, providing additional avenues for career consideration.

Interpretation of Results
Confidence Score: This metric represents the model's level of certainty regarding its prediction, expressed as a percentage.

A high confidence score (e.g., 80-99%) indicates a strong statistical correlation between the skills enumerated in the resume and the primary requirements of the predicted job role.

A lower confidence score (e.g., 20-50%) suggests that while the identified skills are a plausible match, they may also be applicable to several other similar professions, a common outcome for generalist or hybrid skill sets.

Troubleshooting Common Issues
Extended Page Load Time:

This is typically attributable to the reinitialization of the backend API from an idle state. It is recommended to wait up to one minute for the process to complete. If the issue persists, refreshing the page and resubmitting the file is advised.

Error Message on Display:

An error stating "Could not connect to the prediction API" signifies a potential temporary interruption or restart of the backend server. click on this link <https://job-role-suggestor-api.onrender.com> . wait for the application to load , and then go back to vercel app.

An error mentioning "Could not read the PDF" suggests that the submitted file may be corrupted or in an unsupported format. Re-saving the document as a new PDF file and attempting the upload again may resolve this issue.

It is our hope that this tool proves to be a valuable asset in your professional career exploration.
